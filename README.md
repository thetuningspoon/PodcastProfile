#PodcastProfile

Podcast feed generation/publishing profile for the ProcessWire CMS

## About the Podcast Profile

Manage your podcasting with ProcessWire! The Podcast Profile is a fully featured iTunes podcast publishing platform built using nothing more than ProcessWire's basic fields/templates/pages system. Automatically generates an XML feed for submission to iTunes. Fully implements the iTunes podcasting specification (https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html) and supports managing an unlimited number of podcasts and episodes from the same installation. Accommodates both on-site and off-site file hosting.

## Instructions

1. Upload a fresh copy of ProcessWire to your server and extract the folder from the zip file to the root directory of the new installation. Install ProcessWire as usual. When asked to select a site profile, choose "Podcast Profile".
 
2. Once installed, you can add a new Podcast via the "Add New" menu in the upper right portion of the admin panel.
 
3. Fill out the podcast details and then begin adding episodes under the podcast page, or via the "Add New" menu.
 
4. The XML file for each podcast is generated at http://www.yoursite.com/podcast-name/ (The url of the podcast page)
 
5. Use this URL to submit the podcast to iTunes at https://phobos.apple.../publishPodcast
